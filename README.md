# SAMs-MOD
A project aimed at unifying a host of separate DCS SAMs modifications, some of which are defunct or abandoned.   This project's aim is to keep that hard work alive, as well as consolidate that work into a single source for centralization.  Not for control, but for allowing for multiple inputs, expertise and effort from talented contributors from across the DCS ecosystem.   The goal is to continue regular bug fixes, enhancements and new future models/units to the systems that are in use within DCS as a single Mod, not multiple conflicting mods.


## Known Issues and Current State
Feel free to check the Issues tab above for more detailed information.  Below are the major issues that the team is aware of:


Also see the wiki page on Current State for individual system inclusion and it's status.


## Credits and Contributions
See the wiki page for source recognition for the hard work of those projects that came before this. It should be noted that the licensing for any contributions has been validated from previous sources, and any future contributors explicitly agree to the licensing model of this project for their work to be considered for inclusion.  We are building this for the DCS community as a non-profit, gratis community effort.


## Bounty List
A list of community wishlist items from the official DCS Forums thread. Bear in mind that requests do not constitute acceptance as additions, as some systems asked for are simply not able to be accurately modeled within the DCS engine. These wishlist items are open for contribution, but it should be noted that there is required work to be done for each (texturing, animations, LODs) to make it into the official Mod.
